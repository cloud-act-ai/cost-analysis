# FinOps360 Cost Analysis Dashboard

A comprehensive cloud cost analysis tool with environment cost breakdowns, trend analysis, and forecasting capabilities. The system analyzes both Production and Non-Production costs with percentage breakdowns and provides detailed visualizations.

## Features

- **Unified Environment Dashboard**: View PROD and NON-PROD costs together with percentage calculations
- **Trend Analysis**: Track daily and monthly cost trends with historical comparisons
- **Fiscal Year Comparisons**: Compare costs across different fiscal years (FY24, FY25, FY26)
- **Forecasting**: Predict future costs based on historical patterns and growth trends
- **Product Analysis**: View costs by product ID with Production/Non-Production breakdown
- **Average Daily Cost Metrics**: Analyze cost data using average daily spend rather than raw totals
- **Interactive HTML Reports**: Generate detailed HTML reports with interactive charts and tables

## Quick Start

1. Edit `config.yaml` with your BigQuery settings:
```yaml
bigquery:
  project_id: your-project-id
  dataset: your-dataset
  table: cost_analysis_new
  avg_table: avg_daily_cost_table
```

2. Run the dashboard with a single command:
```bash
./run.sh
```

This script will:
1. Always use BigQuery for data access
2. Generate interactive charts if Plotly is installed
3. Create a comprehensive HTML dashboard with visualizations

## Installation

1. Install required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Enable interactive charts by installing Plotly:
```bash
pip install plotly>=5.14.0
```

3. Set up your BigQuery credentials (if needed):
```bash
export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=/path/to/credentials.json
```

4. Authenticate with Google Cloud (optional):
```bash
gcloud auth login
gcloud config set project your-project-id
```

## Project Structure

The application has been streamlined with a clean architecture:

- `app/`: Main application code
  - `main.py`: Primary entry point
  - `dashboard.py`: Dashboard generation logic
  - `data_access.py`: BigQuery data access functions
  - `data/`: Schema definitions and SQL scripts
  - `templates/`: HTML templates for the dashboard
  - `utils/`: Utility modules for configuration, BigQuery access, and chart generation
- `reports/`: Generated HTML reports
- `run.sh`: Main script to run the application

## Usage

### Advanced Usage

The dashboard offers interactive charts with the following features:
- Filter by environment (PROD/NON-PROD)
- View forecasted costs
- Explore product cost breakdowns
- Analyze trends and patterns

You can run the underlying Python module directly:

```bash
python -m app.main
```

Options:
- `--output`: Output HTML file path
- `--config`: Path to config file
- `--template`: Path to HTML template
- `--no-interactive`: Disable interactive charts
